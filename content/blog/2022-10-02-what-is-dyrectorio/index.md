## Fries & ketchup – dyrector.io explained to a kid

Imagine you’re at McDonald’s with your family and instead of having all of your fries at the same time, someone brings them to you piece by piece. It wouldn’t be so much fun for you or the people who work there. You would have to wait for the next fry and the workers would have to come to your table again and again.

Now imagine you wanted your favorite sauce, like ketchup or mayo with it. The workers would be so busy bringing all the fries to your table, they’d probably forget about the sauce or switch it up with something you wouldn’t like, mustard for example. Even worse, they might bring a tomato and tell you to make your own ketchup.

To make it a lot faster and not mess up your order, McDonald’s serves your fries in a piece of paper and your ketchup in a small tray. This way nobody has to waste their time and you can have all your fries fast.

dyrector.io is like the paper cone used by McDonald’s to serve fries faster for software and the people who’d like to use them.

## Self-service deployments – dyrector.io explained to a college graduate

Chances are that the apps you use every day, Spotify or Netflix, aren’t just one application but many smaller ones making up one large software. It’s because improving and maintaining them by taking small but more frequent steps is a lot easier than making one big change to the software over a longer time period.

When the software is made up from smaller applications, it’s called a microservices architecture. Making the changes to the code takes a lot of time and effort from the developers but you still wouldn’t be able to use the application. It has to be installed or deployed to a server which requires another type of expertise. The engineers responsible for setting up the applications are usually too expensive for smaller organizations, and even for them it can be a time-consuming process. To accelerate it, some organizations created automations and platforms that allow staff to do deployments self-service or at least simplify them. Many teams don’t have the resources to create their own platforms, though.

> “Why can’t developers deploy, then?” The important thing to mention here is that developers usually don’t like to work on deployments, and many times they aren’t trained for setting up and maintaining applications.

No wonder the _No Deploy Fridays_ movement gained traction. They’d rather spend their time developing applications to create value for users. While deployments are necessary part of software development, they don’t mean much value to users. Moving the responsibility of deployments from developers  to automations and other teammates, releases time and effort they can use to develop.

dyrector.io is the platform for small teams and developers who couldn’t care less about deployments. It still brings a lot of value for enterprises with complex deployment processes, when a decision-maker has to approve some changes, or industry standards and legal obligations require some sort of governance with non-technical people involved. Deployments are reduced to a few clicks so even project managers or others who aren’t engineers can execute them. It allows teams to deploy their applications without repetition to save time and money to further improve their software.

## CD platform for developers – dyrector.io explained to an engineer

dyrector.io is an open-source CD platform for developers to manage releases, multi-instance deployments and configurations in Kubernetes & Docker. It’s not only beneficial for DevOps & Cloud engineers who can deploy faster with the abstractions provided by dyrector.io, but also for non-technical staff who can finally turn deployments self-service.

There are many things that make dyrector.io special.

- **CD tailored to your CI:** Automate deployments of your images dropping out of your already existing CI workflows. Less time spent on YAML files; more time spent on developing your applications.

- [**Intuitive UI to simplify releases:**](https://docs.dyrector.io/tutorials/deploy-your-product) Besides automated deployments, non-technical stakeholders are able to trigger self-service deployments with the help of our easy-to-use UI.

- **No strings attached:** You can use dyrector.io without any vendor lock-in, meaning you’re able to deploy to on-premises machines and environments hosted by AWS, GCP, and Azure.

- [**Multi-instance deployments:**](https://docs.dyrector.io/features/multi-instance-deployments) Complex release processes turned simple with dyrector.io’s multi-instance deployments use case when your team can manage multiple versions on different nodes at the same time.

The cherry on top of dyrector.io is how easily you can turn your own rig into a test environment. You can get your app ready for testing or demos in a matter of seconds. Besides, the platform sends notifications of deployment statuses on Slack and Discord to increase collaboration.

## Summary

dyrector.io impacts many stakeholders in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The users can get their fries faster, non-technical staff can turn deployments self-service when technical teammates aren’t available, and engineers can manage their releases and deployments as simple as they want them to be.
