**2022 was a busy year for dyrector.io’s engineering squad. Tons of new features and releases were published to offer simple application deployments to users. This grants them a spot on Santa’s nice list for this holiday season. Here are their wishes, including QA related adjustments, and Kubernetes MFA improvements.**

‘Tis the season to make a wish hoping it comes true. We asked the engineers of dyrector.io what they would like to be different or solved to make their life easier.

## Better API documentation

What’s better than API documentation? Good API documentation. Unfortunately, most of the time the people who write API docs are engineers who’d rather do anything else than documenting. Managing documentation as a chore that needs to be dealt with because it needs to be dealt with is the wrong approach. We’ve seen many times how lazy it is to explain what the config variable is by copying and pasting its name above it – without further context it won’t mean a thing to the user. Can’t blame engineers for that because their expertise covers areas other than creating user-friendly documentation.

For this reason, our engineers would appreciate it if APIs came with just a little bit better documentation. Include responses, and examples because it’d save a lot of time for the API’s users which is a very good advantage to have compared to APIs covering similar, or the same use cases. Not to mention plain-text snippets that can be copied with a single click. That’d deserve a chef’s kiss from our engineers.

## Unified registry gateway

This is a 100% dyrector.io related wish on Santa’s list. Working with multiple registries is one thing. Working with different types of registries is a whole another deal that can and should be simplified.

dyrector.io helps users with moving things in a unified manner. Accessing and managing multiple registries in one place regardless of whether they’re from Docker Hub, Google or GitHub is essential to save time for users who just want to get things done as quickly as possible. That’s why dyrector.io, the platform helps users to select and configure images from different sources by supporting the most widely used technologies out there.

## Configuration management without compromises

Another dyrector.io specific wish is configuration management that has all the benefits while leaving the disadvantages in the dust. Config management is a critical aspect of operations because it allows users to store secrets and other things without an ounce of care for months or years and when the time comes, the variables are still there in a way that can be comprehensible even if staff who set it up don’t work there anymore.

We found that most solutions of configuration management provide great advantages for the sake of sacrificing other areas. There are very easy to use, easy to integrate solutions that can’t be difficult to manage. But on the other hand, some solutions that are easy to manage are too complex.

Our plan with dyrector.io is to provide simplified configuration management that’s simple to integrate and easy to manage at the same time.

## Hide low resolution displays from QA

Our web developers know the struggles of QA approaching them with visual glitches that won’t appear on 100% scaled displays. While it’s possible that some users still use low-res displays, chances are, especially in the case of software engineers, that they use either at least one FHD or 4K display. It would make sense to live up to low-res requirements but as long as the product is still usable, the amount of value delivered by fixing non-fatal visual glitches is questionable compared to the time spent on them.

## Use compiled languages instead of interpreted ones

Our team is heavily divided on this matter. Recently we came out with a **[blog post](https://blog.dyrectorio.com/2022-12-05-ups-and-downs-of-golang/)** praising Go, while offering solutions and workarounds of its differences from other languages.

Both compiled and interpreted languages offer advantages. Compiled ones are generally faster and translating them doesn’t require any resources. At the same time, they lack the flexibility interpreted languages provide.

## More Go projects, and more Discord for communication

Here’s one for the fans of interpreted languages: more projects written in Go. “Maybe we could’ve made dyrector.io’s UI in Go, as well. It would’ve been for the better. But that’s maybe just my opinion” – said our own Secretary of Golang, Nándor when asked what he would like for Christmas.

Another teammate of ours asked for turning Discord to the de facto communication tool instead of other platforms. We use it for our team’s communication and to interact with our community, and we absolutely love it. If you’d like to join our Discord community, you can do it **[here](https://discord.gg/hMyT9cbYFD)**.

## Native MFA support for Kubernetes

There are many ways to keep your Kubernetes cluster secure. The only drawback is that there aren’t straightforward solutions. Some of them are either cloud provider specific or they need extra work that can be simplified. For this Christmas, our engineers put natively supported MFA for Kubernetes on the wish list. And they’re all on the nice list, so Santa should be able to put it in their stockings, right?

## STB header only C libraries ported to Zig

STB libraries – made by Sean T. Barrett, hence the name – are rad, and some folks in our team love to use them. But they’d enjoy working with them a lot more if they were ported to Zig. It’s a more recent language compared to C, and Zig offers quality of life improvements, including more convenient error handling compared and compile-time metaprogramming.

## Bun to achieve increased adoption

Kind of connected to the wish list item of Zig ported STB libraries comes Bun, the JavaScript runtime which is written in Zig. Some members of our engineering team love to use Bun because it’s a fast Node.js implementation and they’d like the project to be around for a long time. Therefore, this item is rather a wish for a long & prosperous life for Bun, which tallies up more than 36 000 stars on GitHub when this blog post is published.
